          <h2>Why STEM?</h2>
          <p>So many of our children are extremely competent using iPads, phones and computers. However, this ability to use technology does not necessarily mean they are IT savvy. Being able to upload a selfie or change your status on social media does not make someone technologically competent.</p>
          <h4>The Design Process</h4>
          <p><img src="Images/tech student 1.JPG" alt="" width="400" height="302" class="flt_lft img-responsive"/>In order for us to be able to enjoy the latest technological innovations, these innovations had to be conceived, planned, tried, tested, created and then launched and evaluated. Understanding the design process is essential for students to learn, as many of them will be using this process in their adult lives to solve problems using creative and innovative solutions. So what is the design process? Very simply, it is a series of steps to follow in order to ensure you end up with the best design for the problem. There are many different versions of the design process available; however, they all look something like this: </p>
          <p>• Ask. What is the problem? </p>
          <p>• Imagine. Brainstorm ideas and select the best one. </p>
          <p>• Plan. Draw a labelled diagram and make a materials list. </p>
          <p>• Create. Make your design and test it. </p>
          <p>• Improve. Make it better. </p>
          <h4>Designing for all ages </h4>
          <p>The good thing about the design process is that it is easy to understand for even very young students. My Year Three students completed a number of engineering challenges at the end of Term Four. The ideas for the challenges stemmed from our Unit of Inquiry on How We Express Ourselves. Our central idea was that different cultures express their ideas, feelings, beliefs and values through stories and art. As part of their inquiry, students researched fairy tales from a range of different countries.</p>
          <p><img src="Images/confetti 1.JPG" alt="" width="400" height="276" class="flt_rgt img-responsive"/>You may very well ask how you add engineering design challenges into a unit on fairy tales. As you know, most fairy tales end with a royal wedding, and a royal wedding is not complete without confetti launchers! Their second challenge involved creating a 3D castle using only newspaper and sticky tape. For each of these challenges, students followed the design process. Many students were quite put out when their first creation was not what they had hoped for. However, it was wonderful to watch as they refined their ideas, collaborating with their team members to come up with new and improved techniques and designs.</p>
<p>This ‘if at first you don’t succeed, try again’ philosophy also builds resilience. Many students get frustrated if their very first effort fails. When students are working on a project which has a very high interest for them, they are inclined to keep on trying in order to succeed. This persistence can then be transferred to tasks they are less interested in, or which are much more difficult. As a teacher I can say ‘remember when…’, and they have more confidence in their ability to try and succeed.</p>
<h4>Give it a go!</h4>
<p>Design thinking is basically an approach to learning that focuses on developing students’ creative confidence. Using their imaginations is essential, and this hands-on approach to learning encourages even the most reluctant learners. From designing a castle using newspaper and sticky tape, to creating a web page or tablet application, the design process is helping our students tap into their creative selves in order to come up with amazing solutions to problems, creating resilient, lifelong learners. </p>
