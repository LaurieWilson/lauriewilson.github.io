  <h2>Praise for Merciless Gods</h2>
      <h3>How can it be that in an era when literature's power to shock has been tested to the point of exhaustion, Christos Tsiolkas retains the ability to do just that? Tsiolkas' genius partly lies in his willingness to embrace all the vulgar thoughts, acts and objects that many other writers consciously exclude in order to achieve their more rarefied ends … the other glory of the stories … are the many instances of tenderness, sensuality and unashamed enunciation of desire they contain.</h3>

      <hr>
      <h3>After five novels Christos Tsiolkas has released his first collection of short stories, and it's well worth the wait. Merciless Gods is a collection of vitality, clever angles, shock value, power and unexpected delicacy … As a collection, the stories play off each other superbly … Although the stories span 20 years, there's a collective sense of an author growing into a recognition of his mortality, an awareness that generates both edge but also generosity, the acceptance of people and their foibles that can grow out of the shared knowledge of the inevitability of our demise … Perhaps the greatest ability of Tsiolkas is his ability to communicate energy through the static medium of the printed page … One can only hope we don't have to wait another 20 years for the next collection.</h3>

      <h3> </h3>
      <h3>Merciless Gods begins with its 45-page title story. It is stunning and should be read by everyone in the country who cares about fiction. It is worth the price of the book ... what's remarkable is the steady stream of fine, poised stories that can so easily encompass shocking subject matter but have a balance, a power of restraint, that is the hallmark of art. Tsiolkas' development is so remarkable that it brings to mind ... the all but absolute gap between the postmodern skittishness of the early Almodovar and those extraordinary humane Sirkian masterpieces of the great Spanish filmmaker's later work ... in mid-career [Tsiolkas] has produced fiction of such power and compositional grace with its hand so sure of its sense of the pulse of the world.</h3>
